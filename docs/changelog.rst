Changelog
=========

v0.6.0 (2020-10-13)
-------------------
- Support Python 3.8
- ``%s`` now matches any sequence of exactly three digits.  Previously, it
  matched either '0' or any sequence of digits not beginning with '0'.  Thanks
  to `@chosak <https://github.com/chosak>`_ for the patch.


v0.5.0 (2019-05-21)
-------------------
- Improved the routine for assembling ``request_time`` from
  ``request_time_fields``:

  - If the month is only available as a full or abbreviated name and the name
    is not in English, try looking it up in the current locale
  - If the year is only available in abbreviated form (the ``%y`` directive)
    without a century (``%C``), treat years less than 69 as part of the
    twenty-first century and other years as part of the twentieth
  - When necessary, use the values of the ``%G``, ``%g``, ``%u``, ``%V``,
    ``%U``, ``%W``, and ``%w`` time directives to derive the date
  - If ``%Z`` equals ``"GMT"``, ``"UTC"``, or one of the names in `time.tzname`,
    produce an aware `~datetime.datetime`

- ``%{%n}t`` and ``%{%t}t`` now match any amount of any whitespace, in order to
  match :manpage:`strptime(3)`'s behavior
- **Breaking**: Renamed the ``request_time_fields`` keys for ``%{%G}t`` and
  ``%{%g}t`` from ``"week_year"`` and ``"abbrev_week_year"`` to ``"iso_year"``
  and ``"abbrev_iso_year"``, respectively
- ``%{%p}t`` can now match the empty string (its value in certain locales)
- ``%{%Z}t`` can now match the empty string


v0.4.0 (2019-05-19)
-------------------
- Support the ``%{c}h`` log directive
- ``%f`` and ``%R`` can now be `None`
- **Bugfix**: ``%u`` can now match the string ``""`` (two double quotes)
- Support ``mod_ssl``'s ``%{*}c`` and ``%{*}x`` directives
- Support the ``%{hextid}P`` directive (as a hexadecimal integer)
- Support the ``%L`` and ``%{c}L`` directives
- Parameters to ``%{*}p``, ``%{*}P``, and ``%{*}T`` are now treated
  case-insensitively in order to mirror Apache's behavior
- Refined some directives to better match only the values emitted by Apache:

  - ``%l`` and ``%m`` no longer accept whitespace
  - ``%s`` and ``%{tid}P`` now only match unsigned integers
  - ``%{*}C`` no longer accepts semicolons or leading or trailing spaces
  - ``%q`` no longer accepts whitespace or pound/hash signs


v0.3.0 (2019-05-12)
-------------------
- Gave `LogEntry` a `~LogEntry.directives` attribute for looking up directive
  values by the corresponding log format directives


v0.2.0 (2019-05-09)
-------------------
- Changed the capitalization of "User-agent" in the log format string constants
  to "User-Agent"
- The ``cookies``, ``env_vars``, ``headers_in``, ``headers_out``, ``notes``,
  ``trailers_in``, and ``trailers_out`` attributes of `LogEntry` are now all
  case-insensitive `dict`\s.


v0.1.0 (2019-05-06)
-------------------
